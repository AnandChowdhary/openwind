# 🎨 Openwind

A collection of interface elements built using [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com), completely free and open source.

## 🙋 Why

The creators of Tailwind.css recently introduced [**Tailwind UI**](https://tailwindui.com), a freemium set of UI components. I highly recommend you purchase a Tailwind UI plan, it's a great one-time investment for building interfaces, and it helps support the creators.

This library, however, is an MIT-licensed (free and open-source) set of UI components. Think of it like Tailwind UI, much more limited but free. You can use these components instead if you have a limited budget, or if you require MIT-licensed code.
